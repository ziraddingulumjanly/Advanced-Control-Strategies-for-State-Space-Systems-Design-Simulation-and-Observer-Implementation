Advanced Control Strategies for State-Space Systems: Design, Simulation, and Observer Implementation
This project focuses on designing and simulating advanced control strategies for state-space systems, including full-state feedback controllers, integral action, and observer implementations. It includes mathematical derivations, stability analysis, and Simulink simulations to validate system performance under disturbances.
